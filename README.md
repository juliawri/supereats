# SuperEats

 SuperEats is a food ordering service designed to reduce food waste and allow more people to access food delivery services. 
 
 SuperEats has several features which make it top-quality.

*We allow restaurants to sell both cooked food products and bulk food items, such as hamburger buns, to customers at a discounted price. While some apps facilitate the sale of takeout to prevent food waste, none allow for consumers to buy wholesale products as well.


*We give restaurants choice by allowing them to choose how large of a discount they want to apply to their food items.


*We profit by taking a small cut of the restaurantâ€™s revenue. This allows for our business to be scalable because as more customers and restaurants sign onto our website, the amount of profits we can re-invest into our business will grow.


*In the future, we hope to partner with delivery companies to facilitate the delivery of products customers buy on our website right to their door.
