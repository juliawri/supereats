    <h3> SuperEats is a project that we created in order to fight the issue of food wastage. </n> Too many restaurants choose to waste uneaten food and we wanted to 
    help. So, with this app, we try to put customers in touch with restaurants that have a surplus of food to sell, and the customer can choose their own healthy, 
    fresh meal. </h3>
